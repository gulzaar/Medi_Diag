 ### Introduction
 
 This Project aim  to develop an application for pattern classification of cancerous and 
 non-cancerous tumor cells by implementing artificial neural network
 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~	
   App. features include:
 
     *  Highly sophisticated, C   application operating on the minimal 10 characteristics 
         of classified inputs obtained from the 
 
     *  Overall accuracy of app. is 96.34%. It is tested on based of 683 sample.
 
     *  Simple to Use Console interface.and many more...
